# Codefundo-phase-2

Our Software is particularly useful for the Government to notify all the required departments in a very convenient and efficient manner.
 
Only thing the government or any disaster related authorities must do is issue an official warning of the time, place and magnitude of the disaster. Based on this, depending on the location and height above sea -level the place is, it will notify the further departments to do the needful.
       for eg. If a tsunami warning has been issued, then the authorities will get the notification of the warning. Also a detailed list of things to do will be displayed. This will help them to plan all the needful measures to be taken well in advance.

Also, past case studies and detailed analysis of the area, like height of the buildings nearby, condition of them, etc. will be considered while giving instructions to the authorities.
 
The same software can be used by the hospitals and health-care centres. They will also get the notification of the warning, in order to help them plan in the right way.

The software would also have a separate portal wherein the medical centres and hospitals can          communicate with each other, during the disaster. This would be of great use to ensure minimal loss of time for the treatment of victims.
         For eg.  If a victim at a medical centre is in need of an urgent blood transfusion, an alert for the same can be put up on that portal and the hospital that can provide that particular blood group (these details are pre-loaded into the software’s database after verification with a medical practitioner) can get the patient air-lifted to their hospital.   
The application will also have an open to all interface, wherein anybody who is in need of some specific help can put up a message and the software would automatically forward that message to

         1. All relief/rescue forces and medical centres
         2. Relatives of the person in question, whose details would be pre-loaded into the software’s  
              Database
This would be of great help to anybody in need of urgent help, particularly during and after a disaster.
Anybody who is in a position to help can then directly get in touch with the person via the same platform.
